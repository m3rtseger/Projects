# Projects
[CNN for multiclass image classification](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/DeepLearningCNN.ipynb)
* Experiment: training 3 distinct CNN models to explore the impact of varying architectures(pooling, dropout, batch normalization,..) on model performance. Implemented Early Stopping, halting training if no improvement occurs in the validation loss. Using CIFAR-10( 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)
* Key libraries: PyTorch, sklearn, pandas

[Diabetes Risk Prediction](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/ClassicML_Classification.ipynb)
  * Experiment: k-NN, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees to predict diabetes risk from health and lifestyle data. Decision Trees emerged as the top model after hyperparameter tuning with an implemented nested cross-validation and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques.
  * Key libraries: scikit-learn, imblearn, pandas
