# Projects
[CNN for multiclass image classification](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/DeepLearningCNN.ipynb)
* Experiment: training 3 distinct CNN models to explore the impact of varying architectures(pooling, dropout, batch normalization,..) on model performance. Implemented Early Stopping, halting training if no improvement occurs in the validation loss.
* Dataset: CIFAR-10, 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
* Key libraries: PyTorch, sklearn
