# Projects
[CNN for multiclass image classification](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/DeepLearningCNN.ipynb)
* Experiment: training 3 distinct CNN models to explore the impact of varying architectures(pooling, dropout, batch normalization,..) on model performance. Implemented Early Stopping, halting training if no improvement occurs in the validation loss. Using CIFAR-10( 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)
* Key libraries: PyTorch, sklearn, pandas

[Diabetes Risk Prediction](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/ClassicML_Classification.ipynb)
  * Experiment: k-NN, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees to predict diabetes risk from health and lifestyle data. Decision Trees emerged as the top model after hyperparameter tuning with an implemented nested cross-validation and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques.
  * Key libraries: sklearn, imblearn, pandas

[Clustering on reviews data and PCA](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/Clustering_PCA.ipynb)
* Experiment: applying K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) to discover patterns in user ratings for various attractions from Google reviews. Included dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization.
* Key libraries: sklearn, scipy, pandas

[Top-Noted X(Twitter) Accounts: influence and content](https://github.com/m3rtseger/Projects/blob/main/SocialMediaAnalytics.ipynb)
* Experiment: a brief analysis of X accounts frequently flagged by "Community Notes" for potentially misleading information. The methodology involves data scraping, utilizing X's API, and some NLP tools for content analysis (topic modelling with BERTopic and sentiment).
* Key libraries: selenium, tweepy, nltk, BERTopic

[Visual Story: environmental sustainability and rule of law](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aVJE7KzIdl8Hts7QEvpV446j-mHoD2hk?usp=sharing)
* Experiment: this project visually explores the relationship between nations' environmental sustainability, as measured by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), and adherence to the Rule of Law (RoL).
* Key Libraries: Altair (interactive geospatial and bar chart visualizations), seaborn, pandas
